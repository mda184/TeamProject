Hey guys, so I figure we could just use a general file like this to throw around design ideas.

**Our CSS file sucks and needs vast improvement. Bootstrap?

-sign up screen (text boxes & etc) -- on index page, or accessible through hyperlink?
-if we don't put sign up on index, what will we put on there?
-sign in form top right?
-settings/preferences tabs top right? what options to include?
