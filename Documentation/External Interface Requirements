3.1 User Interfaces

The first interface will be our login screen. In this interface the user will have to input their username and password to gain access to their
account and profile.

We intend to have an interface for creating and post and all of the associated functionalities such as commenting, uploading images and publishing content

As well an interface for shared interaction between users such as the study groups and lost and found.

3.2 Hardware Interfaces

-The system must be connected to the internet.
-The system will be deployed on a MUN server that will connected using a port number.
-Network interaction will use https

3.3 Communications interface

The system will interact with the database to retrieve any necessary data related to the user, friends, groups and content
- Possibly talk about TCP/IP???

3.4 Software interfaces
Along with an internet connection. The system will makes indirect use of an internet browser. As mentioned before, this application is written in
Node JS(version ???) with use of mongodb (version ???) as the database. Other than that, the system does not tell any software what to do.
(This probably needs some better description)
