Some notes:

Not sure if this is the best way to handle profiles. Could be a variable in users? 
Currently, a profile is loaded by calling the profiles list with a user object. Let me know if you guys have any thoughts.


Need to figure out how notifications/search bar works. Is it one UI that overlays all other overlays? If so, we need to think about how to add this to sequence diagrams.
